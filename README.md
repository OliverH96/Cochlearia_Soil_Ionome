## Soil Ionome Imputation
For soil ionome data imputation, gridding and imputation was performed using [SurferÂ®](https://www.goldensoftware.com/products/surfer)

Grids were generated using manually-fitted variograms (Gridding/MFV/) and auto-fitted variograms (Gridding/AFV/). Grids for each element can be found in their respective directories. Gridding/MFV/imputation_setup.xlsx contains the variables used to fit MFV grids.
