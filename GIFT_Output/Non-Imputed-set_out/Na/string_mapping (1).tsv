1	AT2G01980.1	3702.AT2G01980.1	SOS1	Sodium proton exchanger, putative (NHX7) (SOS1); Encodes a plasma membrane-localized Na+/H+ antiporter SOS1. Functions in the extrusion of toxic Na+ from cells and is essential for plant salt tolerance. Has 12 predicted transmembrane domains in the N-terminal region and a long cytoplasmic tail of approx. 700 aa at the C-terminal side. SOS1 interacts through its predicted cytoplasmic tail with RCD1, a regulator of oxidative-stress responses, suggesting that SOS1 might function in oxidative-stress tolerance; Belongs to the monovalent cation:proton antiporter 1 (CPA1) transporter (TC 2.A.

2	AT1G47600.1	3702.AT1G47600.1	BGLU34	Thioglucoside glucohydrolase 4; Beta glucosidase 34; Hydrolyzes sinigrin and, with lower efficiency, p- nitrophenyl beta-D-glucoside
3	AT4G10310.1	3702.AT4G10310.1	HKT1	High-affinity K+ transporter 1; Sodium transporter protein, which plays a central role in plant tolerance to salt. Upon prolongated exposure to high concentrations, Na(+) translocates from the roots to the transpiring leaves where it can increase to toxic level. Involved in Na(+) recirculation from shoots to roots, probably by mediating Na(+) loading into the phloem sap in shoots and unloading in roots, thereby removing large amounts of Na(+) from the shoot. Does not transport K(+) but regulates K(+) nutrient status via its ability to facilitate Na(+) homeostasis. Probably not involved [...] 
4	AT4G10330.1	3702.AT4G10330.1	AT4G10330	Uncharacterized protein F24G24.130; Glycine-rich protein; Has 3957 Blast hits to 1040 proteins in 164 species: Archae - 18; Bacteria - 176; Metazoa - 2052; Fungi - 68; Plants - 1288; Viruses - 62; Other Eukaryotes - 293 (source: NCBI BLink)
5	AT2G46790.1	3702.AT2G46790.1	PRR9	Two-component response regulator-like APRR9; Transcriptional repressor of CCA1 and LHY, and positive regulator of LWD1 and LWD2 expression. Controls photoperiodic flowering response and temperature compensation. Involved in the positive and negative feedback loops of the circadian clock. Expression of several members of the ARR-like family is controlled by circadian rhythm. Regulated at the transcriptional level by a corepressor complex consisting of ELF4, ELF3, and LUX. APRR9, APRR7, and APRR5 coordinately act on the upstream region of the target genes to repress their expression from [...] 
6	AT2G47000.1	3702.AT2G47000.1	ABCB4	Atp-binding cassette, subfamily b (mdr/tap), member 1; ABC transporter B family member 4; Auxin influx transporter that mediates the transport of auxin in roots. Contributes to the basipetal transport in hypocotyls and root tips by establishing an auxin uptake sink in the root cap. Confers sensitivity to 1-N-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA). Regulates the root elongation, the initiation of lateral roots and the development of root hairs. Can transport IAA, indole-3-propionic acid, NPA syringic acid, vanillic acid and some auxin metabolites, but not 2,4-D and 1-naphthaleneacetic acid
8	AT2G47250.1	3702.AT2G47250.1	AT2G47250	Pre-mrna-splicing factor atp-dependent rna helicase dhx15/prp43; May be involved in pre-mRNA splicing
9	AT2G47260.1	3702.AT2G47260.1	WRKY23	Probable WRKY transcription factor 23; Transcription factor. Interacts specifically with the W box (5'-(T)TGAC[CT]-3'), a frequently occurring elicitor- responsive cis-acting element (By similarity)
10	AT2G47485.1	3702.AT2G47485.1	AT2G47485	At2g47485; Unknown protein; BEST Arabidopsis thaliana protein match is: unknown protein (TAIR:AT3G62650.1); Has 35333 Blast hits to 34131 proteins in 2444 species: Archae - 798; Bacteria - 22429; Metazoa - 974; Fungi - 991; Plants - 531; Viruses - 0; Other Eukaryotes - 9610 (source: NCBI BLink)
