Cexcelsa_scaf_1,4092437,g10739.,gene,AT2G01980.1,"Note=sodium proton exchanger, putative (NHX7) (SOS1): curator_summary=Encodes a plasma membrane-localized Na+/H+ antiporter SOS1.  Functions in the extrusion of toxic Na+ from cells and is essential for plant salt tolerance.  Has 12 predicted transmembrane domains in the N-terminal region and a long cytoplasmic tail of approx. 700 aa at the C-terminal side. SOS1 interacts through its predicted cytoplasmic tail with RCD1, a regulator of oxidative-stress responses, suggesting that SOS1 might function in oxidative-stress tolerance.: symbol=SOS1: full_name=SALT OVERLY SENSITIVE 1: computational_description=sodium proton exchanger, putative (NHX7) (SOS1): conf_class=2: conf_rating=****: "
Cexcelsa_scaf_1,8721292,g11642.,gene,AT1G47600.1,Note=beta glucosidase 34: curator_summary=Encodes a myrosinase. Over-expression led to a glucosinolate profile change.: symbol=BGLU34: full_name=beta glucosidase 34: computational_description=beta glucosidase 34: conf_class=2: conf_rating=****: 
Cexcelsa_scaf_2,4114298,g40302.,gene,AT4G10310.1,Note=high-affinity K+ transporter 1: curator_summary=encodes a sodium transporter (HKT1) expressed in xylem parenchyma cells. Mutants over-accumulate sodium in shoot tissue and have increased sodium in the xylem sap and reduced sodium in phloem sap and roots.: symbol=HKT1: full_name=high-affinity K+ transporter 1: computational_description=high-affinity K+ transporter 1: conf_class=2: conf_rating=****:

Cexcelsa_scaf_6,5963898,g50798.,gene,AT2G46790.1,"Note=pseudo-response regulator 9: curator_summary=Pseudo-response regulator PRR9. Involved in clock function. PRR7 and PRR9 are partially redundant essential components of a temperature-sensitive circadian system. CCA1 and LHY had a positive effect on PRR9. Interact with TOC1 in a yeast two-hybrid assay. Acts as transcriptional repressor of CCA1 and LHY.  Acts additively with EC, PRR5 and PRR7 to regulate hypocotyl growth under photoperiodic conditions.: symbol=PRR9: full_name=pseudo-response regulator 9: computational_description=pseudo-response regulator 9: conf_class=2: conf_rating=****: "
Cexcelsa_scaf_6,6008695,g50808.,gene,AT2G47000.1,Note=ATP binding cassette subfamily B4: curator_summary=Encodes an auxin efflux transmembrane transporter that is a member of the multidrug resistance  P-glycoprotein (MDR/PGP) subfamily of ABC transporters. Functions in the basipetal  redirection of auxin from the root tip. Exhibits apolar plasma membrane localization in the root cap and polar localization in tissues above and is involved in root hair elongation.: symbol=ABCB4: full_name=ATP-binding cassette B4: computational_description=ATP binding cassette subfamily B4: conf_class=4: conf_rating=***:
